                <p>About Me:</p>
                <h4>I am a Media Arts and Science major with a specialization in Game 
                    Design along with a minor in Theatre Arts. I'm very passionate about working hard to do my absolute best in all of my classes and to always put in the extra mile. Putting in that extra effort and exceeding any expectations drives me to keep doing my best. I currently have 
                    experience with Java, Python, HTML, CSS, and Maya software. My skills include plenty of computer knowledge, a broad voice range with singing, improv skills, dancing abilities, and acting skills.
